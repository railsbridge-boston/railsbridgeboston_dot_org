    <p>Do you dream of someday writing software that helps people and improves the world?</p>
    <p>Led by an all-volunteer team of seasoned, enthusiastic Ruby and Rails developers, the workshop introduces people of all backgrounds to the concepts, tools, and techniques of Ruby and Rails development. Our audience is those with no or little programming experience.</p>
    <p>We welcome you to the Boston Ruby community. Whatever your goal is in learning to program, we hope to connect you with the tools to take the next step.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Promoting Diversity</h2>
    <p>The Boston software community needs more people from diverse backgrounds. RailsBridge is for those underrepresented groups. This includes, but is not limited to, those who identify as women, people of color, LGBTQ, military veterans, and more. If you do not fall under these or similar groups, you are still welcome to come as someone's guest.</p>
    <p>We support parents who want to code, so we will provide childcare to those who need it. Please let us know if you want to use this service when you register for the workshop.</p>
